# CDNThumbnailer

CDNThumbnailer is a php tool for dynamically image resizing. It is distributed with a cache and a CDN controller to allow quick files access. It include compatibility with GD and ImageMagick php extension.

This tool is written in **PHP 5.2** to maximize compatibility (but in a **PHP 5.3** style).

## Documentation, help

This tool can be used as a library inside a project for image resizing. It can also be included as a HTTP Proxy for image resizing.
It is compatible with external images and allow dynamic resizing and serving of images.

If you need to use it as a proxy, there are some initialization to perform:

 - Copy [SAMPLE.htaccess](SAMPLE.htaccess) to *.htaccess* (this new file is ignored by .gitignore), replace **%{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/cache** by the absolute path to the cache folder and **RewriteBase** by the valid one in your project.
 - Copy [config/SAMPLE.config.inc.php](config/SAMPLE.config.inc.php) to *config/config.inc.php* and update the **CACHE_FOLDER** constant if you use a custom layout (let it if not).
 
To call the CDN, you need to use URLs like that:

 - **http://[yourhost]/28x28/path/to/your/image.png** : This URL request the file *cache/28x28/path/to/your/image.png* to be served. If exists, it is returned, else the file *cache/original/path/to/your/image.png* will be used as master for resize (if this file does not exists, HTTP Status code is returned as 404).
 - If you use external images as content source, you need to defined the scheme in the URL: **http://[yourhost]/http/28x28/host.com/distant/your/image.png**. This URL will download the image http://host.com/distant/your/image.png if exists and use it as master for resizing. The distant image is put in the original folder to forbid multiple downloads of the same image.

HTTP Status code are used to manage errors:

 - If the original file to be used for resize does not exists, the **HTTP 404** code is sent
 - If the server encounter a problem during image processing, the **HTTP 500** code is sent
